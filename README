Function that takes the DNA sequence and the enzyme recognition sequence (both 5' to 3'), and displays "The recognition sequence was not found" if the enzyme recognition sequence was not found in the DNA strand or displays the DNA sequence showcasing in lowercase letters the enzyme recognition sequence along with an answer TRUE or FALSE to confirm that the final answer is the same as the DNA sequence taken by the function, which should always be TRUE. Also, if the DNA sequence is shorter than the enzyme recognition sequence, the function returns an error.
